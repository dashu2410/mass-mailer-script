This is an automatic mailer script, so that you can send personalized emails to multiple people (in this example, by changing the name in the salutation according to the receivers name)

Please follow the steps to use the auto-mailing script
1- Go to send_mail_uni.pl, open with a text editor, and follow instructions given in the first comment.
2- Fill the file 'mailing list' with the names of the people you want to send the mails to (exactly how you want it in the salutation) followed by their email id's. an example would be
Lmn	abc@xyz.com.
NOTE: only use the surname for this example.
3- make the script executable by this command:
chmod +x script.sh
4- execute the script through command line to send all the mails by this command:
./script.sh
5- sit back and relax :)

I highly recommend sending a sample mail to yourself before sending it to anyone important.
